# The-Gardener's-Journal
## Overview

_`The Gardener's Journal ` is a place to collect and organize all of your gardening information:  details, plans, dreams and aspirations!_


<br>

## MVP


### for  _The **Gardener's Journal**_  I will:

- Have a **RESTful JSON API**.
  - Build a **Ruby on Rails** server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints.
  - Build a database with at least 3 tables, with at least 1 association.
  - Utilize **Rails** to define models for interacting with the database.
  - Implement working generic controller actions for Full CRUD (`index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) between non-User tables 

- Have a working, interactive **React** app, built using `npx create-react-app`.
  - Have at least 8 separate, rendered components in an organized and understandable React file structure.
  - Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
  - Utilize state and props in your components efficiently.
  - Use _only_ React for DOM Manipulation.
- Consume data from  **Ruby on Rails API**, and render that data in components.
- Utilize **React Router**, for client-side routing.
- Demonstrate Full CRUD actions ( `index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` ) on the front end.

### Styling 

- Styled with CSS (or learn and attempt SCSS, if time permits).
- Use Flexbox and/or Grid in layout design.
- Implement media queries for responsive design.

### Linting 

- Indent properly.
- Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
- Follow `camelCase`, `snake_case`, and `kebab-case` convention.
- Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
- Remove commented out code; leave only functional notes and comments.

### Deployment

- Deploy the back-end via Heroku.
- Deploy the fully functional front-end via Netlify.

### Procedural 

- Initialize a git repo on Github**, with a link to the hosted project.
- Create a Development Branch, and make frequent commits
- Use effective and safe branching and merging processes.



<br>

### Goals

- _Back-end setup, with full CRUD, day one;_
- _Front-end setup, day two;_
- _Front-end full CRUD, day three;_
- _Styling and optional Post MVPs, day four;_
- _Present, day five._

#### Component Tree

#### Component Hierarchy

> This reflects how I expect the directory/file tree to look. 

``` structure

client/src
|__ containers/
      |__ MainContainer.jsx
      
|__ layouts/
      |__ Layout.jsx
        |__ Header.jsx
        |__ Footer.jsx
      
|__ screens/
      |__ CreatePlant.jsx
      |__ EditPlant.jsx
      |__ LoginRegister.jsx
      |__ PlantDetail.jsx
      |__ Zones.jsx
      
|__ services/
      |__ app-config.js
      |__ auth.js
      |__ plants.js
      |__ zones.js

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._
