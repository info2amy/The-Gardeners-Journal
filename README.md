# The-Gardener's-Journal
## Overview

_**The Gardener's Journal** is a place to organize all of your ._


<br>

## MVP


for  _The **Gardener's Journal**._  I will:

- Have a **RESTful JSON API**.
  - Build a **Ruby on Rails** server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints.
  - Build a database with at least 3 tables, with at least 1 association.
  - Utilize **Rails** to define models for interacting with the database.
  - Implement working generic controller actions for Full CRUD (`index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) between non-User tables 

- Have a working, interactive **React** app, built using `npx create-react-app`.
  - Have at least 8 separate, rendered components in an organized and understandable React file structure.
  - Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
  - Utilize state and props in your components efficiently.
  - Use _only_ React for DOM Manipulation.
- Consume data from your **Ruby on Rails API**, and render that data in your components.
- Utilize **React Router**, for client-side routing.
- Demonstrate Full CRUD actions ( `index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` ) on the front end.
  - _Note that if you decide to implement Auth, your full CRUD actions must be covered amongst your non-User tables._

### Styling <!-- omit in toc -->

- Be styled with CSS (or SCSS, if you'd prefer).
- Use Flexbox or Grid in your layout design.
- Implement 2 media queries for responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop).

### Linting <!-- omit in toc -->

- Indent properly.
- Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
- Follow `camelCase`, `snake_case`, and `kebab-case` convention.
- Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
- Remove all `console.log()`s and commented out code (functional notes and comments are okay).

### Deployment <!-- omit in toc -->

- Deploy the fully functional front-end via Surge or Netlify.
- Deploy the back-end via Heroku.
- Deploy early and often(this will help to debug small issues before they become large issues)

### Procedural <!-- omit in toc -->

- Initialize a **git repo on Github**, with a link to your hosted project.
- Have **frequent commits**, making a _robust_ commit history at least every day. (75 commits minimum)
- Use effective and safe **branching and merging** processes.

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._
